## My process
My method for working on projects is to start with the structure first by using HTML. I play around with the flex box, flext items, margins and paddings to get each item in the right position. Or at least close to. Then, I add myy CSS styles. Lastly, I add the background color and image and edit the footer.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
